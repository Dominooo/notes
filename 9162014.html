<h1>COMMAND_LINE_THINGS</h1>


pwd - present working directory

cd ../../ - Move out multiple directories
cd ~ - Back to home directory
cd / - All the way to root directory (yikes)

ls - list
ls -lah     - detailed list (including hidden files)
ls -lah 'dirName' - detailed list within a directory

TAB key can autocomplete folder names. (2 char needed first)

history - keeps history of commands you've run. (!num to run)
UP_KEY - cycle up through previous commands.

mkdir - makes a folder (space new folder name)
Clear output with CMD + K

<h1>html & css</h1>

!important  -  Not for general use. Good for debug. (infinite specificity) 

cmd + bracket is like hitting tab. (iOS trick)

example below...

nav .button {
  
}

When your browser reads a selector it actually looks from the inside out of a selector. Like - .button - nav

/example


nav.button   both class of button and the nav tag

#menu nav.button   both class of button and the nav tag within menu

nav .button  children withing nav with class of button.

.container #menu #logo.new     both id of logo and new that exist within menu within container.

_________________________________________


D.R.Y - Don't repeat yourself

.mainclass{
  all the styles
}

.red {
  all the styles + red
}

.blue {
  all the classes + blue
}

____________________________________________

background: url();
background-size: contain; cover; or 100% auto;
background-color: red;

all can be shortened to just- background:


<img src="">  -- no closing tag. what what?

____________________________________________

This is the box model
http://www.w3schools.com/css/box-model.gif

padding is getting fat
margin is personal space

Margin is technically outside of the box model.
____________________________________________

box-sizing: border-box;  (if you have a box to take up 100% and also want to have padding it calculates the padding then fills up the rest)

If you had a box that was 100% and then add padding it would go off the edge of the screen.

____________________________________________

float: left;  -  similar to inline-block. 

.clearfix {
  clear:both;
}

clear:both; is the way to get rid of a float property. Add it as an additional class on something to get it to not float.



display: block; is pretty much default. respects width and margin visually but really takes up the full width.

display: inline; is only taking up the space it needs. Doesn't respect margin or width.

display: inline-block; similar to float left. does respect widht and margin. Doesn't take the whole width. Has odd behavior of putting 1em between stuff sometimes.

__________________________________________

<link href="styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">

This is the way to link to a css page.

Normalize.css is best practice to reset the styles across all browsers.

position static- default behavior, don't need to declare unless undoing previous changes.

absolue postioning- based on position within the document.

relative positioning- declare a top, bottom, left, right coords to position.

position fixed- based on screen. Stays in place even when scrolling. (navigation always at the top)

a parent with position relative can have an absolute child that will be relative to the parent's container.

z-index does not work without declaring a position.

75 characters is the recommended max width for a block of text.

progressive enhancement.  (same as graceful degredation)

because css cascades you can put something for old browsers like just a bg color, but then, overwrite it with newer features if they are supported by the browser. if they arent supported they'll be ignored.

Mobile first-  make smart decisions when designing that let you give mobile and desktop equal support.
(see xkcd ven diagram about school website)  Helps you cut down to what is important. makes for a better desktop experience too.

------------------------------

Media queries-

sort of like if statement. 

@media screen and (max-width:900px), (orientation: landscape){
  .box {
    background: red;
  }
}

one example of "Screen" as a media query is having a separate print style.

other media queries-

orientation- portriat or landscape

in a media query you can add a comma to say "or" (),()

Use media queries when your design breaks. (shouldnt be ever 20 pixels or you know you have a bigger design problem)

using % for styling saves lots of trouble and should need less media queries.

 display: flex;
  justify-content: center;    --- horizontal centering
   align-items: center;  ---- verticle centering

    -  flex-start   - flex-end
  flex-direction: column-reverse;   or row



START   MIDDLE   END   is the order for flex-start.


START
MIDDLE
END

is the order when usin column


transition: background 0.8s ease;

hover, active, visited

DASH - offline documentation for various api's. in appstore.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no">   "viewport metatag" is needed for mobile scalability.

overflow hidden hides a bigger div's extra girth within a smaller container.
overflow scroll is the same, but you can scroll to see it all. (but will always show scroll bar even if not needed)
overflow auto is your bro. only shows scroll if needed.
you can also do overflow-x: auto; and it will only show if within a constraint like only x axis, can do y too.


calc- 100% - 300px

font-family: lets you change the font.  1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice.

google fonts - only choose the fonts to include, the more the bigger the file. copy the css link and paste into the head so you can have it in your project.
