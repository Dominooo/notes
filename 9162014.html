<h1>COMMAND_LINE_THINGS</h1>


pwd - present working directory
cd 'dirName'  - Change directory in deeper
cd ..  -  Move one directory up
cd ../../ - Move out multiple directories
cd ~ - Back to home directory
cd / - All the way to root directory (yikes)

ls - list
ls -lah     - detailed list (including hidden files)
ls -lah 'dirName' - detailed list within a directory

TAB key can autocomplete folder names. (2 char needed first)

history - keeps history of commands you've run. (!num to run)
UP_KEY - cycle up through previous commands.

mkdir - makes a folder (space new folder name)
Clear output with CMD + K
rmdir - remove directory (space then folder name)

Folders are case sensetive.

touch 'file name' - Creates a file
rm - more powerful delete
rm -rf 'filename' - wipe an entire folder FOREVER!!!!

<h1>GIT</h1>

Git is version control.

typing git will give you a boat load of options

git init - creates hidden tracking dir for git 
git status - pwd of git. whats happening.
git add 'file' - stages changes to be grouped for commit.
git commit -m "commit message here" - commits files
git commit -a -m "commit message here" - commits all files

IF YOU GET STUCK IN VIM- I, MSG, ESC, :, X, ENTER

git push origin master - pushes to github
git pull origin master (carefull. be ready.)
git remote add origin 'url'
git clone 'url' - pulls down an existing project

<h1>html & css</h1>

!important  -  Not for general use. Good for debug. (infinite specificity) 

cmd + bracket is like hitting tab. (iOS trick)

example below...

nav .button {
  
}

When your browser reads a selector it actually looks from the inside out of a selector. Like - .button - nav

/example


nav.button   both class of button and the nav tag

#menu nav.button   both class of button and the nav tag within menu

nav .button  children withing nav with class of button.

.container #menu #logo.new     both id of logo and new that exist within menu within container.

_________________________________________


D.R.Y - Don't repeat yourself

.mainclass{
  all the styles
}

.red {
  all the styles + red
}

.blue {
  all the classes + blue
}

____________________________________________

background: url();
background-size: contain; cover; or 100% auto;
background-color: red;

all can be shortened to just- background:


<img src="">  -- no closing tag. what what?

____________________________________________

This is the box model
http://www.w3schools.com/css/box-model.gif

padding is getting fat
margin is personal space

Margin is technically outside of the box model.
____________________________________________

box-sizing: border-box;  (if you have a box to take up 100% and also want to have padding it calculates the padding then fills up the rest)

If you had a box that was 100% and then add padding it would go off the edge of the screen.

____________________________________________

float: left;  -  similar to inline-block. 

.clearfix {
  clear:both;
}

clear:both; is the way to get rid of a float property. Add it as an additional class on something to get it to not float.



display: block; is pretty much default. respects width and margin visually but really takes up the full width.

display: inline; is only taking up the space it needs. Doesn't respect margin or width.

display: inline-block; similar to float left. does respect widht and margin. Doesn't take the whole width. Has odd behavior of putting 1em between stuff sometimes.

<link href="styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">

This is the way to link to a css page.

Normalize.css is best practice to reset the styles across all browsers.

position static- default behavior, don't need to declare unless undoing previous changes.

absolue postioning- based on position within the document.

relative positioning- declare a top, bottom, left, right coords to position.

position fixed- based on screen. Stays in place even when scrolling. (navigation always at the top)

a parent with position relative can have an absolute child that will be relative to the parent's container.

z-index does not work without declaring a position.

75 characters is the recommended max width for a block of text.

FLEXBOX   ---- LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS!!!!!   css tricks complete guide to flexbox - google that

need a parent!

<div class="parent">
  <div class="box one"></div>
  <div class="box two"></div>
  <div class="box three"></div>
</div>

.parent {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-betwwwn;
  flex-direction: column; (or row or row-reverse)
  align-items: center;   ------- centers vertically!!!!!!!   wtf SWAG YOLO
}

.box {
  height and width and bg and margin
}

.one {
  order: 2;
}

progressive enhancement.  (same as graceful degredation)

because css cascades you can put something for old browsers like just a bg color, but then, overwrite it with newer features if they are supported by the browser. if they arent supported they'll be ignored.

Mobile first-  make smart decisions when designing that let you give mobile and desktop equal support.
(see xkcd ven diagram about school website)  Helps you cut down to what is important. makes for a better desktop experience too.

------------------------------

Media queries-

sort of like if statement. 

@media screen and (max-width:900px), (orientation: landscape){
  .box {
    background: red;
  }
}

one example of "Screen" as a media query is having a separate print style.

other media queries-

orientation- portriat or landscape

in a media query you can add a comma to say "or" (),()

Use media queries when your design breaks. (shouldnt be ever 20 pixels or you know you have a bigger design problem)

using % for styling saves lots of trouble and should need less media queries.

 display: flex;
  justify-content: center;    --- horizontal centering
   align-items: center;  ---- verticle centering

    -  flex-start   - flex-end
  flex-direction: column-reverse;   or row



START   MIDDLE   END   is the order for flex-start.


START
MIDDLE
END

is the order when usin column


transition: background 0.8s ease;

hover, active, visited

DASH - offline documentation for various api's. in appstore.

MDM - Mozilla developer 


<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no">   "viewport metatag" is needed for mobile scalability.

do - downlaod canary

overflow hidden hides a bigger div's extra girth within a smaller container.
overflow scroll is the same, but you can scroll to see it all. (but will always show scroll bar even if not needed)
overflow auto is your bro. only shows scroll if needed.
you can also do overflow-x: auto; and it will only show if within a constraint like only x axis, can do y too.


calc- 100% - 300px

font-family: lets you change the font.  1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice.

google fonts - only choose the fonts to include, the more the bigger the file. copy the css link and paste into the head so you can have it in your project.

Javascript fundamentals

JS provides functionality.

Nothing to do with Java.

DOM  -   Document Object Model

all the elements that create a website or webapp

javascript allows you to hook into events like button clicks or selecting something.

can do things asynchrynously without refreshing the page.

database layer for javascript.

how the web works - http://alpha.ideavis.co/529cc5f

node is javascript on a server

// is a single line comment

/*
multi line comment
*/

recommend only using single line comments due to regex issues.

Operators

= assigns
== compare values             33 == '33'  true
=== compare values and types  33 === 'false'
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal
truthy vs falsy  truthy returns true falsy returns false

vars are normally written in camelCase

declare, then initialize, or do them in the same comment

var name = 'joe'  does all three.

if statements

if (condition) {
  //code
}

functions are reusable bits of code.

function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
  //code
  //optional return statement
}

functionName is just a variable
functionName() is active and being called

var makeACat = function () {
  expression             (to be called later)
};

function makeACat() {
  function decleration  (used on page load)
}



Test Driven Development
Start with a goal in mind ^
create a series of tests, and if they pass you're done.

------------------------------------------------
example of expression-

var functionName = function(parameter) {
  var myReturnVariable = 'hello ' + parameter + '!';
  return myReturnVariable;
}

functions are like a blender, fruit are variables and it returns a single smoothie.

\ backslash is the escape character

use single quotes to avoid problems with quoted text in strings.

if you're ever writing something twice, create a function silly billy.

variables have a functional scope. 

how to correctly do a variable.

var getFred = function() {
  var fred= 'I/'m fred';
  return fred;
}                        ---- Functional

var name = getFred();   ---Global
sayHello(name);


you can put a function in a function.

if the nested one is called "inner" you'd say "getFred.inner"



LOOPS

Never put a semicolon after a curly bracket unless it's a functional variable. Mostly never though.

for(var i = 0; i < value; i++) {
  //do something each iteration
}

used to iterate over something a set amount of times.

while used to check something that doesn't involve a set ammount of iterations.


while(condition) {
  // do something
}

for example while false, don't let the user continue. If true let them.

condition can be anything that is truthy or falsy

var userInput = false;
while(userInput === false){
  //Please input a name
}


an array is like a backpack. It holds many items that can be strings, numbers, etc.

purpous to store many items in one var.

DONT- var arrayName = new Array();

DO- var arrayName = [];

comma separate things in an array.

the only diff in declaring an object vs an array is the brackets [] vs {}

arrays always start counting at zero

if you try to access something that doesn't exist you get 'undefinged'

indices are the items ordered in an array.


arrays have property and methods

property-  arrayName.length returns length.

method- a function inside an object.

arrayName.push(element, element)  adds elements to end of array

arrayName.pop() pops off the last items and it's gone

arrayName.shift() removes the first item in array.

arrayName.unshift() adds to beginning

stringName.split() turns a string into an array.

arrayName.join() turns an array into a string.

arrayName.slice() return a copy of a portion of an array

arrayName.reverse() obvious

----------------------------

var person = ['hair','height','age','gender'];

array is cool, but you don't know info about the things stored in it.

var person = {}

objects have keys and values.

var person = {
  hairColor: 'brown'
}

hairColor is the key.  Brown is the value.

person.hairColor;  -- will return 'brown'


var person = {
  hairColor: 'brown',
  name: 'jake'
}


console.log(person.name + 'has ' person.hairColor + "hair.")


add keys and values to an object using .

person.age = 28;


var devin = {
  name: 'devin',
  age: 26
};

devin.age += 1    is the way to add one to that value.


var devStudents = []

devStudents.push(devin)

var jeramy = {}

jeramy.name = 'Jeramy';
jeramy.age = '100'

devStudents.unshift(jeramy)

how to access objects in an array.
need to know it's index and value.

alert(devStudents[0].age);

I can get both out -

alert(devStudents[0].name + devStudents[0].age);

another way is -

for (var i = 0; i < devStudents.length; i++) {
console.log(devStudents[i]);
}

I can get all the keys in an object-

for(var key in devin){
  console.log(key)
}

for(var key in devin){
  console.log(devin[key])
}

Objects don't have order.

be very careful of this-

for(var key in devin){
  devin[key] = "haha ";
}

changes every value to haha.

another way other than devin.name is a for in loop

for(var key in devin){
  if(key === name){
  devin[key] = 'Devin'
  }
};


to add to all arrays in an object-

for(var i =0; i < devStudents.length; i++){
  devStudents[i]['status'] = 'student;'
}


to find the index of an array in an object-


for (var i = 0; i < devStudents.length; i++){
  if(devStudents[i].status === 'Mentor'){
    devStudents.splice(i, 1);
  }
}


to delete a key-

delete myObject.key;


! (bang) is used to see if something is falsy

to see if truthy

for (var key in object) {
  if (object[key]) {

  }
}


That's it! wow.
